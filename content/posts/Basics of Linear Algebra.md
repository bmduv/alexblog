# Scalars
Scalars are 0th order tensors (ordinary represented as lower-cased letters).

# Vectors
Vectors are 1st order tensors and thought of as fixed-length array of scalars usually denoted by bold lowercase letters.
- To indicate that a vector contains n elements, we write we write $x \in \mathcal{R}^n$ and call the dimensionality of the vector. (order is used to refer to number of axes)

# Matrices
Matrices are 2nd order tensors denoted by bold capital letters and represented as tensors with two axes. 
- $A \in \mathcal{R}^{m\space x\space n}$ indicates that matrix $A$ contains $m \space x \space n$ real-valued scalars arranged as m rows and n columns 

# Tensors
Tensors are the overall term used to describe nth order arrays that can have arbitrary number of axes.
- Basic Properties of Tensor Arithmetic:
   - Elementwise product of two matrices is called the Hadamard Product (denoted )
