- EMG Features extracted from three domains - time domain (TD), frequency domain (FD), and time-frequency domain (TFD)
- Response time of gesture recognition needs to be short/fast to be perceived as real-time:
	- feature extraction takes additional time -> but using time domain as itself requires no additional processing and reduces total response time
- TD:
	- fast and easy to implement since they don't require additional processing/transformation (raw EMG signal)
	- previous evidence that they show transient state of gestures well
	- prone to errors due to non-stationarity of EMG signals
- SVM, KNN, ANN, CNN, PNN classification models have shown at least 90% accuracy in classifying four-ten hand/finger gestures -> but still dealing with high accuracy/low response time challenge
- Overview
	- fixed electrode placement using only TD features employing ANN, SVM, RF, and LR
	- three different muscles on forearm + six TD features extracted from each channel = 18 TD features as input data
- Time-domain Features:
	- Root Mean Square
	- Variance
	-  Mean Absolute Value
	- Slop Sign Change
	- Zero Crossing
	- Waveform Length
- Stratified ten-fold cross-validation grid search for parameter tuning
- Statistical Analysis of performance:
	- Mean and SD of accuracies of all subjects used (since each model was trained on individual's separate data)
	- one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Games-Howell post-hoc tests for accuracy evaluation
	- variance of accuracies of different machine learning methods evaluated using F-tests with false discovery rate correction

## EMG Signal Preprocessing:
- EMG signals can get noise from movement artifacts or electrical interference. 
	- filtering techniques to remove such noise is crucial for preprocessing and better performance of models
- Wavelet analysis
	- wavelet de-noising (can efficiently eliminate white Gaussian noise)
- Higher order statistics
- Empirical mode decomposition
- ANN
- Independent component analysis

## EMG ML Pattern Recognition:
- Support Vector Machine:
	- Supervised algorithm for classification tasks, learns to fit a hyperplane most suitable for classifying different classes in feature space -> shown improved accuracy for predicting knee angles and recognizing finger movements
- Artificial Neural Networks:
	- Has been used for recognizing hand gesture
- K-Nearest Neighbors:
	- Unsupervised method that groups data points according to majority class of its closest neighbors   -> classify EMG signals based on how closely they resemble previously identified patterns.
- Random Forest:
	- Unsupervised Ensemble Learning in which several decision trees' predictions are combined to increase robustness and generalization (noise resistance)
- Hidden Markov Model:
	- System with unobservable states represented by HMM statistical model -> useful where sequence of muscle activations are crucial since they are used to identify temporal patterns in EMG signals.
- Convolutional Neural Network:
	- Used to extract features for time-frequency representations
- Long Short-term Memory Networks:
	- Useful for temporal pattern analysis (RNN)
- Extreme Learning Machines:
	- Feedforward neural network with single hidden layer that chooses hidden layer weights at random    -> provides strong generalization and quick learning
- Linear Discriminant Analysis:
	- Unsupervised method used to identify linear feature combination in the feature space that best divide various classes
